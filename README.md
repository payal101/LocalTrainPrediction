Rush Hour Prediction for Mumbai Local Trains

Mumbai Local Trains are the breath of Mumbai.
The peak timings and rush hours were often unknown to me when I first started travelling. The wave of crashing crowds when the Malad station comes in and the peak hours of 9 am is unnerving.

With this project I aim to merely represent this daily-story of  Western Railway  Peak Rush Hours and predict the passenger crowd and capture its heart-beat.
